# Mastering Java for Data Science
This is the code repository for [Mastering Java for Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-design-patterns-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786460677), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Java is the most popular programming language, according to the TIOBE index, and it is a very typical choice for running production systems in many companies, both in the startup world and among large enterprises.

Not surprisingly, it is also a common choice for creating Data Science applications: it is fast, has a great set of data processing tools, both built-in and external. What is more, choosing Java for Data Science allows you to easily integrate the solutions with the existent software, and bring Data Science into production with less effort.

This book will teach you how to create Data Science applications with Java. First, we will revise the most important things when starting a Data Science application, and then brush up the basics of Java and Machine Learning before diving into more advanced topics.We start with going over the existing libraries for data processing and libraries with machine learning algorithms. After that, we cover topics such as classification and regression, dimensionality reduction and clustering, information retrieval and natural language processing, deep learning and big data.

Finally, we finish the book by talking about the ways to deploy the model and evaluate it in production settings.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("alpha");
list.add("beta");
list.add("beta");
list.add("gamma");
System.out.println(list);
```

You need to have any latest system with at least 2GB RAM and a Windows 7 /Ubuntu
14.04/Mac OS X operating system. Further, you will need to have Java 1.8.0 or above and
Maven 3.0.0 or above installed.
